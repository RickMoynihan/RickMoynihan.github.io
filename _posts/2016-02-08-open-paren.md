This is the start of what may become a dumping ground for working
notes on software development.  I've had blogs before but found my ego
got in the way of my writing.

Unfortunately removing ego from writing is an impossible act, as every
_I_ contains a personality trait desparate to force itself on others
or seek approval and praise.  I don't believe either of these are
something I want or care for, yet the fact I've written five I's in
this sentence seems to speak more about my true motives, than I'm
willing to admit.

I don't really have many hopes for this project, but perhaps it will
become a pastebin of notes and instructions, more than a podium, or
place for commentary, argument and debate.

Not that many people will care, but the blog is a Jekyll blog using
[Mark Otto's Poole theme](http://getpoole.com/) with a few
unremarkable tweaks.
